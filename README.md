# pradyumsoni.com

Source for [pradyumsoni.com][4], hosted on GitHub Pages. Functions as an online
resume/portfolio, as well as a place for me to rant & rave about technology and
math. 

To build the site locally, do

	git clone https://github.com/pradyum1999/pradyum1999.github.io.git
	cd pradyum1999.github.io
    gem install bundler # to get the dependency manager that jekyll uses
	bundle update # to make sure all ruby gems are up to date
	bundle exec jekyll serve
	
Then navigate to `localhost:4000` in your browser to view the page.

Site is built in jekyll on top of [Minimal Mistakes][1]. Uses images from
[Unsplash][2]. If you have questions, drop me a line at [pradyumsoni.com](mailto:contact@pradyumsoni.com).
