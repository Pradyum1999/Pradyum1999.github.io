I am Pradyum Soni, a senior undergraduate at **IIT Bombay**. I'll be graduating with a B.Tech. in Chemical Engineering in July '21. Throughout my stay at IITB, I have explored several engineering disciplines and have become highly interested in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I have done several projects and internship that has equipped me to step into the industry.

During my stay at IITB, I was part of various institute bodies like 
[SARC](https://sarc-iitb.org/), [Hostel 9 Council](https://www.google.com/search?q=h9+iitb&client=ubuntu&hs=la0&channel=fs&sxsrf=ALeKk03EoGf09ncCA-BFdoGPkTEdI0asng%3A1621969134627&ei=7kitYOzdJa2T4-EPy5uN4A0&oq=h9+iitb&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBAgjECcyCAguEMcBEK8BOgcIABBHELADUNg3WPw7YIQ-aAFwAngAgAHMAYgBxgiSAQUwLjUuMZgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrIAQjAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwjsjOzwweXwAhWtyTgGHctNA9wQ4dUDCA0&uact=5), [Mood Indigo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_Indigo_(festival)) & [E-cell](https://www.ecell.in/2020/).

I was also actively involved with the dramatics clubs of IITB, Fourthwall. In my pre-final year, I was the contingent leader for dramatics responsible to build 5 teams (60 students strong) & represent IIT Bombay at Inter-IIT cultural meet. We finished first runner-up, so it was an exhilarating experience. This experience played a major role in shaping my leadership & teamwork outlook.
