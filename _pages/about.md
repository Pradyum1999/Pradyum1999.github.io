# About Me

I am Pradyum Soni, senior undergraduate at IIT Bombay. My semeseter is due around August'21 with summer vacations running effectively from May'21. I hail from Bikaner known for its goldsmith artisans. My father is a goldsmith & mother is a house-maker. 

On the above note, I am proud to share that I am going to be first-generation IITian from my family.

During my stay at IITB, I was part of various institute bodies like Alumni Cell, Hostel Council, Mood Indigo & E-cell. I was also actively involved with the dramatics clubs of IITB, Fourthwall. 

In my pre-final year, I was contingent leader for dramatics responsible to build 5 teams (60 students strong) & represent IIT Bombay at Inter-IIT cultural meet. We finished first runner-up, so it was an exhilarating experience. This experience played a major role in shaping my leadership & teamwork outlook.

On a professional front, I have developed strong interest in Artificial Intelligence owing to my STEM degree & internship experiences. I have been doing courses & projects in python from the past 2 years to strengthen my foundation for the same.

Call it what you will: data science, machine learning, or statistics; the modern technological world lies at the intersection of mathematics and computing, and that's where I like to play.
